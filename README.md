## Project Story

The development of the Atlas Web Back-End began with a focus on creating solid foundational aspects for web applications. Starting with basic authentication and data manipulation techniques, the project evolved to include advanced features such as session management, caching, and queuing systems. Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, including integrating different technologies, ensuring code quality through extensive testing, and optimizing performance.

### Implemented Features

* Basic and session-based authentication
* Data manipulation using ES6 features
* Asynchronous operations with ES6 promises and Python async functions
* Advanced database operations with MySQL and NoSQL
* Comprehensive unit and integration testing
* Caching and queuing systems

### Challenges Encountered

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was integrating various technologies and ensuring they work seamlessly together. Debugging asynchronous operations and optimizing database queries also posed significant challenges. However, these challenges provided valuable learning experiences and contributed to the overall robustness of the project.
